# Digital Scholarship Institute 2021



## Objectives

The DSI seeks to train participants in a core set of methodologies and tools that provide both a knowledge base and the confidence to create assignments that reflect the changing nature of teaching and learning in higher-ed. 

By the end of this institute, participants will 

- Demonstrate confidence in their ability to engage with digital scholarship projects by developing a reusable assignment for an upcoming course 

- Identify the hallmarks of digital scholarship/critical elements and  methodological principles that qualifies scholarly work as digital scholarship 

- Explain the qualities of three specific streams within digital scholarship: GIS mapping; annotation; digital exhibits 

- Envision digital scholarship as a collaborative venture between instructors, local campus experts, such as librarians and professionals in CPI, with whom they feel confident working to develop high-impact assignments to further student learning 

- Establish a cohort as part of this institute to cultivate knowledge sharing and on-going support during and following the institute 

  

## How the Institute will Function


Normally, the Institute would meet in-person and take advantage of the newly  updated Digital Scholarship Lab space in the Rankin Family Pavilion. For this iteration of the Institute, programming will occur synchronously over Zoom. As the schedule below shows, there are two types of sessions: <span style="color:orange">group sessions</span>, where each participant and facilitator will meet, and <span style="color:red">stream sessions</span>, where participants will meet only with colleagues interested in the same stream. <span style="color:orange">Group sessions</span> will feature content that is applicable to each stream, while <span style="color:red">Stream sessions</span> will focus on the particularities of the stream’s main methodology. In this way, we hope that participants will be able to benefit from the insight of the larger group, while also develop a specialized cohort within streams. 

Each 45-minute session is interrupted by a 15-minute break (we encourage you to take full advantage of these breaks). **Please know that** we recognize that participating in a virtual 2.5-day Institute brings with it is own challenges, in addition to the added pressures of working from home. You are not required to be “on” the entire time. We ask that you try to attend and participate during <span style="color:orange">group sessions</span>. During <span style="color:red">Stream sessions</span>, facilitators and other subject experts will be available for consultation. If you face challenges, or want to bounce ideas off others, <span style="color:red">Stream sessions</span> are a perfect opportunity to iron out your chosen project.

## Content Steams

DSI2021 will feature three content streams. While participants will be introduced to all three streams during group sessions and presentations, they will choose **one** stream to work within for the duration of the institute. Each stream will be supported by a lead facilitator. 


### Mapping

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to analyze, display and communicate data that contains a geospatial component. This stream will present two major GIS inspired tools: ArcGIS Online, a lightweight internet-based application that allows you to create interactive maps and [Esri StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/), which combines interactive maps with narrative text, graphic images and other multimedia content to portray your story to the world. Attendees will gain hands-on experience with these two platforms with the end goal of creating a compelling interactive story map. For an example of this technology in action please have a look at the 2020 Esri scholarship winning story map [If Coastlines could Talk](https://arcg.is/1binHX).

### Annotation

Close reading is an analysis method that helps facilitate an in-depth understanding of a piece of text. The difficulty arises when trying to conduct a close reading exercise in a classroom environment. Attendees will explore [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) which is a web-based tool that allows a group to collaboratively read through and annotate a document in real time. Simply by providing a link or uploading a PDF a group can create an environment that allows for an engaging, and rich platform to pour over a body of text. The platform can also be natively embedded in the LMS making for a seamless integration with other course work. See the power of Hypothes.is in action with this marked up rendition of [The Rime of the Ancient Mariner](https://via.hypothes.is/https://www.bartleby.com/101/549.html). 




### Exhibits

Digital exhibits are an excellent way to share and display metadata rich materials digital objects. They are particularly useful in bringing to life digitized material to reach a wider audience. Attendees will dig into the digital exhibit platform [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/). This platform is totally web-based and easy to work with. The only requirement is the collection of digital objects that will be showcased. For an example of a fully developed CollectionBuilder site please consult [White Pine - King of Many Waters Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/whitepine/).
